            <h3><span>Here are a few of the more recent praises we have received from our customers.</span></h3>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>Hi Willie,<br/>
              All the doors look great. I am glad we went with the colonial windows in the garage doors. It really changed the look of our house for the better! Your workers were friendly and professional.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>Thank You,<br/>
              Jennifer and Scott Snell</p>
            <br/>
            <p> My husband and I bought a World War II-vintage home in Basking Ridge about five years ago for a great price. The main reason: among other problems it had the original kitchen with some 1950s “touch-ups.” Cheap plywood, water-stained cabinets, 1950s Formica countertops, and – because it was “updated” -- a window that actually ran behind the cabinets. Since the room is longer than it is wide and had a jut-out behind the refrigerator, the eating area was cut off from the rest of the kitchen, with only a three foot space between stove and refrigerator on either side of the room on the way to the other end of the kitchen where the sink was. A 40-year-old linoleum floor just added to the dreary scene.<br/>
              <br/>
              We received several bids on updates. Most came in at least $50,000 just for basics. A cabinet refinisher wanted $20,000 just to put new doors and repaint the cabinets! Fortunately we wandered into Jaeger Lumber and met Amy Ahearn.<br/>
              <br/>
              We told Amy we had a very small house and an equally small budget. But we wanted to redo the kitchen top to bottom. Amy talked about our needs: our kids were grown, the kind of amenities he had to have and what we could do without. She spent three Saturday mornings just developing possible scenarios for us and showing us possibilities we hadn’t thought of. She visited our house and carefully measured, again talking through what we wanted. Amy was the only designer with whome we talked who listened and who didn’t make us feel bad when we said our budget was limited. Amazing!<br/>
              <br/>
              She didn’t just want to sell us cabinets and counters. Amy talked about the whole kitchen and our lifestyle in it. She suggested the jut-out be removed (it was hollow and an easy fix). She recommended a side-by-side refrigerator to save depth (we now have a wide open space so the room feels whole now). A smaller window was put in so the cabinets weren’t in front of it. And she made cabinet and counter suggestions that were in keeping with the simple style of our house. And all of the cabinets and counters came in at under $15,000. Amy designed our kitchen a year and a half ago. Yet, every morning, I still appreciate her efforts as I step into our lovely kitchen. Every evening, as I prepare dinner, I enjoy the fruits of her design skills.<br/>
              <br/>
              Our kitchen is now the heart of our home.<br/>
              <br/>
              Thanks, Amy!<br />Mollie L.</p>
            <br/>
            
            <p>Dear Willie,</p><br />
            <p>Tanya got home and the garage door opener worked!!  What a relief!  <br /><br />Thank you so so much for all your assistance, for taking the time to talk through and explain the problem with our defective remote, and how everything works with the opener. I cannot express how much I appreciate all your service and help.  By offering your expertise and knowledge on the subject, you saved us a lot of money and time and we appreciate it so very much.</p><br />
            <p>Please send a copy of this email to your manager, because you really went above and beyond and I appreciate it so much. I'm retired and you saved me a lot by putting the extra time and care into helping us find the most cost-efficient way to solve our problem.</p><br />
            <p>Many, many thanks,<br />
            Carol Raftis</p>

            <p> Chris - I hope you and your family are doing well.  Our project is moving along.<br/>
              <br/>
              The constractor installed our windows.  I wanted to let you know that he was very impressed.  He's always worked with {another window}.  He's a certified installer.  But he was willing to go along with the Marvin Integrity given all the things I told him (things you had told/shown us).  He's very pleased with them, and will likely recommend them on future jobs.  Interestingly, one of the other houses he is working on (new construction) specified {another window} - also his first time with that product.  He was *very* unimpressed with them.  He said they felt cheap, and many were bowed.<br/>
              <br/>
              We're thrilled.  Thanks for all your help!<br/>
              <br/>
              Regards,<br/>
              Jim<br/>
              <br/>
              I am writing to tell you how impressed I was by the service and support I received at your Middlesex location from your employee, Robert Skae. Even though Rob has since been relocated to your Union store, I wanted to make sure to give him the accolades he deserves.<br/>
              <br/>
              Last summer my father-in-law and I decided to build a deck on the back of my house. I had never built a deck before so I worked with some friends to develop blueprints for the deck I wanted to build. I then went to three different lumber stores (including Somerville Lunber) and asked for price estimates on all of the supplies needed for the project.<br/>
              <br/>
              Without question, Jaeger was the nicest place to work with and that had to do with Rob. He offered suggestions, spent time with me reviewing the plans and described the differences between different product lines. As the project progressed, he patiently answered my many questions and helped me to secure the supplies I needed.<br/>
              <br/>
              This was my first experience working with Jaeger Lumber. From the minute I walked in the door at Jaeger, I was treated courteously and with respect. Even though Rob was my main point of contact, on the occasions I went to the store and Rob was not there, I was treated just as well by all of your employees. In the past, when I had shopped at other lumber stores, I wasn’t given the time of day because I wasn’t a pro.<br/>
              In the future, I will happily drive past your competitors and give my business to Jaeger. I will also continue to tell my neighbors and friends about your friendly service.<br/>
              <br/>
              Sincerely,<br/>
              Jim Cocca<br/>
