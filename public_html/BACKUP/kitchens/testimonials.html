			<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hi Willie,<br>
			All the doors look great. I am glad we went with the colonial 
			windows in the garage doors. It really changed the look of our house 
			for the better! Your workers were friendly and professional. <br>
			<br>
			Thank You,<br>

			<span style="COLOR: black">My husband and I bought 
			a World War II-vintage home in Basking Ridge about five years ago 
			for a great price. The main reason: among other problems it had the 
			original kitchen with some 1950s &#8220;touch-ups.&#8221; Cheap plywood, 
			water-stained cabinets, 1950s Formica countertops, and &#8211; because it 
			was &#8220;updated&#8221; -- a window that actually ran behind the cabinets. 
			Since the room is longer than it is wide and had a jut-out behind 
			the refrigerator, the eating area was cut off from the rest of the 
			kitchen, with only a three foot space between stove and refrigerator 
			on either side of the room on the way to the other end of the 
			kitchen where the sink was. A 40-year-old linoleum floor just added 
			to the dreary scene.</span></font></p>

			<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="black" size="2">
			<span style="COLOR: black">We received several bids 
			on updates. Most came in at least $50,000 just for basics. A cabinet 
			refinisher wanted $20,000 just to put new doors and repaint the 
			cabinets! Fortunately we wandered into Jaeger Lumber and met Amy 
			Ahearn. </span></font></p>

			<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="black" size="2">
			<span style="COLOR: black">We told Amy we had a 
			very small house and an equally small budget. But we wanted to redo 
			the kitchen top to bottom. Amy talked about our needs: our kids were 
			grown, the kind of amenities he had to have and what we could do 
			without. She spent three Saturday mornings just developing possible 
			scenarios for us and showing us possibilities we hadn&#8217;t thought of. 
			She visited our house and carefully measured, again talking through 
			what we wanted. Amy was the only designer with whome we talked who 
			listened and who didn&#8217;t make us feel bad when we said our budget was 
			limited. Amazing!</span></font></p>

			<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="black" size="2">
			<span style="COLOR: black">She didn&#8217;t just want to 
			sell us cabinets and counters. Amy talked about the whole kitchen 
			and our lifestyle in it. She suggested the jut-out be removed (it 
			was hollow and an easy fix). She recommended a side-by-side 
			refrigerator to save depth (we now have a wide open space so the 
			room feels whole now). A smaller window was put in so the cabinets 
			weren&#8217;t in front of it. And she made cabinet and counter suggestions 
			that were in keeping with the simple style of our house. And all of 
			the cabinets and counters came in at under $15,000. Amy designed our 
			kitchen a year and a half ago. Yet, every morning, I still 
			appreciate her efforts as I step into our lovely kitchen. Every 
			evening, as I prepare dinner, I enjoy the fruits of her design 
			skills.</span></font></p>

				impressed I was by the service and support I received at your 
				Middlesex location from your employee, Robert Skae. Even though 
				Rob has since been relocated to your Union store, I wanted to 
				make sure to give him the accolades he deserves.<br>
				<br>
				Last summer my father-in-law and I decided to build a deck on 
				the back of my house. I had never built a deck before so I 
				worked with some friends to develop blueprints for the deck I 
				wanted to build. I then went to three different lumber stores 
				(including Somerville Lunber) and asked for price estimates on 
				all of the supplies needed for the project.<br>
				<br>
				Without question, Jaeger was the nicest place to work with and 
				that had to do with Rob. He offered suggestions, spent time with 
				me reviewing the plans and described the differences between 
				different product lines. As the project progressed, he patiently 
				answered my many questions and helped me to secure the supplies 
				I needed.<br>
				<br>
				This was my first experience working with Jaeger Lumber. From 
				the minute I walked in the door at Jaeger, I was treated 
				courteously and with respect. Even though Rob was my main point 
				of contact, on the occasions I went to the store and Rob was not 
				there, I was treated just as well by all of your employees. In 
				the past, when I had shopped at other lumber stores, I wasn&#8217;t 
				given the time of day because I wasn&#8217;t a pro.<br>
				In the future, I will happily drive past your competitors and 
				give my business to Jaeger. I will also continue to tell my 
				neighbors and friends about your friendly service.<br>
				<br>
				Sincerely,<br>
				Jim Cocca</span></font><br>
